---

**Deploy once, issue API keys, and let your team run arbitrary (admin) applications safely from their terminals.** Share playbooks to perform common tasks consistently and reliably.

Workstations shouldn't need complex setups. Let remote containers execute commands in a secured and reproducible production-grade environment.

**No more snowflakes, _run envoys_.** ✨

## 🎯 Use cases

- ☁️ **Cloud CLI operations** — AWS CLI, Terraform, Ansible, or any SDK-based tools in remote containers with proper permissions ([AWS CLI example](.runvoy/aws-cli-example.yml))
- ⚙️ **One-off commands** — Run arbitrary commands as you would with `kubectl run` without maintaining an always-running cluster. Example: `runvoy run ping <my service ip>`
- 🏗️ **Resource-intensive tasks** — Builds, test runners and any other heavy workload which require a specific instance type. Tail and share logs in real-time like GitHub Actions ([Build Caddy example](.runvoy/build-caddy-example.yml))
- 🐢 **Long-running tasks** — Commands that may take a long time to complete like schema changes, data migrations, dump/restore operations, etc. ([PostgreSQL restore example](.runvoy/pg-restore-example.yml))
- 📝 **Audit-required operations** — Any command that needs a complete audit trail with user identification
- 🔐 **Secure operations** — Commands with environment variables secrets without exposing them to local workstations

## 📝 Example

## 💡 What is Runvoy?

**Runvoy is composed of 3 main parts**:

- 🖥️ **Backend** — Runs on your AWS account (multi-cloud support planned), exposes the HTTP API, and orchestrates cloud resources. Deploy once as a cloud admin.
- ⌨️ **CLI client** — The `runvoy` command-line tool for interacting with the REST API
- 🌐 **Web app** — Visit [web.runvoy.site](https://web.runvoy.site) or self-host. Currently supports log viewing with full CLI parity coming soon.

Refer to [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## ✨ Key Benefits

- 🖥️ **_Doesn't_ run on your computer** — Commands execute in remote production-grade environments with proper secrets access. Team members only need the `runvoy` CLI and an API key — no complex workstation setup required.

- 📊 **Complete audit trail** — Every backend interaction is logged with user identification. All logs stored in append-only database for compliance (CloudWatch Logs supported, more providers coming).

- 🔓 **Self-hosted, no black magic** — The backend runs in _your_ cloud account. You control everything: policies, permissions, and data.

- 💰 **Serverless** — No always-running services. Pay only for the compute your commands consume (essentially free for infrequent use).

## 🎨 Features

- 🔑 **API key authentication** — Secure access with SHA-256 hashed API keys
- 👥 **User access management** — Role-based and ownership access control. Admins define permissions; users access only what they're allowed to
- 🐳 **Customizable container roles** — Register Docker images with custom roles for proper resource access (AWS ECS+IAM support, more coming soon)
- 📋 **Native cloud logging** — Full execution logs and audit trails with request ID tracking
- 📖 **Reusable playbooks** — Store command configs in YAML, commit them, and share with your team for consistent execution ([Terraform example](.runvoy/terraform-example.yml))
- 🔐 **Secrets management** — Centralized encrypted secrets with full CRUD operations from the CLI
- ⚡️ **Real-time WebSocket streaming** — Live logs delivered to CLI and web viewer via authenticated WebSocket connections
- 🔗 **Automatic Git cloning** — Clone public or private Git repos directly into container working directory ([Build Caddy example](.runvoy/build-caddy-example.yml))
- 🔧 **Unix-style output streams** — Separate CLI logs (stderr) from data (stdout) for easy piping and scripting
- 🏗️ **IaC deployment** — Deploy complete backend infrastructure with CloudFormation (multi-cloud support coming)
- 📦 **Single binary** — Download one ~6MB compressed binary, unzip it and run it. No dependencies, no installation hassle. Available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### 🚧 Roadmap

- 🌍 **Multi-cloud support** — GCP, Azure...
- ⏱️ **Execution timeouts** — Automatic SIGTERM for commands exceeding timeout
- 🔒 **Lock management** — Prevent concurrent execution conflicts
- 🌐 **Full webapp parity** — All CLI commands available in the web interface
- 🍺 **Homebrew support** — Native installation via Homebrew package manager

<!-- VERSION_EXAMPLES_END -->

### 🏗️ Deploying the backend infrastructure

**Requirements:**

AWS credentials and region needs to be configured in your shell environment ([AWS CLI settings docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)), the user needs to have the `AdministratorAccess` and `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policies:

- [AdministratorAccess](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/details/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAdministratorAccess)
- [AmazonECS_FullAccess](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/details/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAmazonECS_FullAccess)

You can review the full list of resources and permissions required for the backend infrastructure in the released [cloudformation-backend.yaml](https://github.com/runvoy/runvoy/releases/download/v0.2.0/cloudformation-backend.yaml) file

Bootstrap the backend infrastructure and seed the admin user:

```bash
runvoy infra apply --configure --seed-admin-user admin@example.com
```

#### 👤 Creating a new user

The admin API key and endpoint are automatically configured in `~/.runvoy/config.yaml` after deployment. Start using runvoy immediately:

```bash
# Register one image to be used as default, pick any image from any public registry
runvoy images register public.ecr.aws/docker/library/alpine:latest

# Run a test command
runvoy run "echo hello world"
```

or

```bash
runvoy users create <email> --role developer # or admin, operator, viewer
```

to create a new user account for a team member. This will generate a claim token that the user can use to claim their API key.

**Important Notes:**

- ⏱  Claim tokens expire after 15 minutes
- 👁  Each token can only be used once

### 🔧 Output Streams and Piping

Runvoy follows Unix conventions by separating informational messages from data output, making it easy to pipe commands and script automation workflows:

- **stderr (standard error)**: Runtime messages, progress indicators, and logs
  - Informational messages (→, ✓, ⚠, ✗)
  - Progress spinners and status updates
  - Headers and UI formatting

- **stdout (standard output)**: Actual data from API responses
  - Tables, lists, and structured data
  - Raw output for piping to other tools

**Examples:**

```bash
# Hide informational messages, show only data
runvoy list 2>/dev/null

# Hide data, show only logs/status messages
runvoy list >/dev/null

# Pipe data to another command (jq, grep, etc.)
runvoy list 2>/dev/null | grep "RUNNING"

# Redirect logs and data to separate files
runvoy list 2>status.log >executions.txt

# Pipe between runvoy commands
runvoy command1 2>/dev/null | runvoy command2

# Use in scripts with proper error handling
if runvoy status $EXEC_ID 2>/dev/null | grep -q "SUCCEEDED"; then
  echo "Execution succeeded"
fi
```

This separation enables clean automation and integration with other Unix tools without mixing informational output with parseable data.

### 🌐 Web Viewer

The web viewer is a SvelteKit-based single-page application that provides:

- **Real-time log streaming** - Automatically get updates from the websocket API in real-time
- **ANSI color support** - Displays colored terminal output
- **Status tracking** - Shows execution status (RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, STOPPED)
- **Execution metadata** - Displays execution ID, start time, and exit codes
- **Interactive controls**:
  - Pause/Resume streaming
  - Download logs as text file
  - Clear display
  - Toggle metadata (line numbers and timestamps)

**Setup (first-time only):**

1. Open the web viewer URL in your browser
2. Enter your API endpoint URL (same as in `~/.runvoy/config.yaml`)
3. Enter your API key (same as in `~/.runvoy/config.yaml`)
4. Settings are saved in browser's localStorage for future use

The web viewer is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by default, but you can configure a custom URL if you deploy your own instance (see Configuration below).

**Configuration:**

The web application URL can be customized via:

- Environment variable: `RUNVOY_WEB_URL`
- Config file (`~/.runvoy/config.yaml`): `web_url` field

If not configured, it defaults to `https://web.runvoy.site/`.

## 💭 The Story Behind Runvoy

As a software engineer, I frequently found myself needing to run admin commands — and more importantly, **enabling my team to run those same commands without becoming a bottleneck**. 🚧

I've always been fascinated by "thin clients" — delegating heavy lifting and security concerns to the server while keeping the client simple. Just "log in" and run the commands you're authorized to run. The server handles the rest. ✨

The final piece fell into place with AWS Lambda and the _serverless_ revolution: **"you only pay for what you use"** is now a commodity in cloud computing. 💰

**Full disclosure:** I love building applications in Go, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to create something genuinely useful — not just for me and my colleagues, but for teams everywhere. 🛠️
