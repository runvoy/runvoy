## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please be respectful, inclusive, and collaborative in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25 or later** - [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for development tasks
- **AWS Account** - For testing backend functionality (optional for CLI-only contributions)
- **Git** - Version control

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/runvoy.git
   cd runvoy
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/runvoy/runvoy.git
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   just dev-setup
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   just install-hook
   ```

6. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Copy example env file (if available)
   cp .env.example .env
   # Or sync from AWS Lambda for local development
   just local-dev-sync
   ```

## Development Setup

```

### Common Commands

The project uses `just` for all development tasks. See all available commands:

```bash
just --list
```

**Essential commands:**

```bash
# Run tests and linting
just check

# Run tests with coverage
just test-coverage

# Build all binaries
just build

# Run local development server
just local-dev-server

# Format code
just fmt

# Lint code
just lint
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow the coding standards (see below)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

**Always run checks before committing:**

```bash
# This runs both linting and tests (also runs automatically on commit via pre-commit hook)
just check
```

**For local server testing:**

```bash
# Start local development server
just local-dev-server

# In another terminal, test with the CLI
just runvoy --help
just runvoy run "echo hello"
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

See [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) for guidelines.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Keep changes small** - Split large changes into smaller, focused PRs
- **Follow Go conventions** - Use `gofmt`, `goimports`, and `golangci-lint`
- **Prefer clarity over cleverness** - Write code that's easy to understand
- **Don't comment unless necessary** - Code should be self-documenting. Use comments only to explain "why", not "what"

### Code Style

1. **Run formatters:**
   ```bash
   just fmt
   ```

2. **Follow linting rules:**
   ```bash
   just lint
   ```

3. **Documentation:**
   - Use function-level documentation for exported functions
   - Keep inline comments minimal - only when code is ambiguous
   - Update `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when making significant changes

4. **Naming conventions:**
   - Follow Go naming conventions
   - Use descriptive names
   - Keep functions focused and small

### Special Considerations

- **README.md auto-update sections** - Don't edit sections between `<!-- CLI_HELP_START -->` and `<!-- CLI_HELP_END -->` markers manually
- **docs/CLI.md** - Auto-generated, don't edit directly. Run `just generate-cli-docs` to update
- **Breaking changes** - The project is pre-alpha, but still document significant API changes

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Aim for high coverage** on new code (80%+ for business logic)
- **Write tests first** when possible (TDD approach)
- **Test error paths** - Don't just test happy paths

### Test Structure

Follow the **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert):

```go
func TestExample(t *testing.T) {
    // ARRANGE - Set up test data
    user := testutil.NewUserBuilder().Build()

    // ACT - Execute the function
    result, err := service.DoSomething(user)

    // ASSERT - Verify results
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run with coverage
just test-coverage

# Run specific package
go test ./internal/auth/...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```

### Test Types

- **Unit tests** - Fast, isolated tests (no build tags needed)
- **Integration tests** - Use `//go:build integration` tag
- **E2E tests** - Use `//go:build e2e` tag

See [docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for comprehensive testing guidelines.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **Export public APIs** - All exported functions, types, and packages should have documentation
- **Function documentation** - Use Go doc comments for exported functions
- **Avoid inline comments** - Only add comments when code needs disambiguation

### Project Documentation

When making significant changes, update:

- **README.md** - For user-facing changes or new features
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - For architectural changes
- **docs/CLI.md** - Auto-generated, run `just generate-cli-docs` after CLI changes

### Example Documentation Update

If you add a new CLI command:

1. Implement the command
2. Run `just generate-cli-docs` to update CLI documentation
3. Run `just update-readme-help` to update README
4. Update relevant sections in ARCHITECTURE.md if needed

## Commit Messages

### Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies, etc.
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace, etc.

### Examples

```
feat: add support for custom timeout per execution

Allow users to specify execution timeout via CLI flag or API parameter.
Defaults to 10 minutes if not specified.

Fixes #123
```

```
fix: handle missing CloudWatch log streams gracefully

Return 503 Service Unavailable instead of 500 when log stream doesn't
exist yet, allowing clients to retry.
```

```
docs: update architecture diagram with simplified component list

Simplified the AWS backend section to list technologies instead of
detailed flow diagram for better readability.
```
