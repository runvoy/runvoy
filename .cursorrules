# Used by: Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI assistants that respect .cursorrules

## Documentation Standards

### Primary Documentation Files
- **README.md** - User-facing documentation (installation, usage, examples)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical documentation (system design, implementation details)

### Documentation Update Policy

**CRITICAL: When making ANY code changes, you MUST update ARCHITECTURE.md if:**
- Adding/removing commands or features
- Changing API contracts or data structures
- Modifying configuration options
- Updating security model or IAM permissions
- Changing execution flow or architecture
- Adding/removing dependencies
- Updating cost implications
- Fixing bugs that affect documented behavior

**After implementing changes:**
1. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new behavior
2. Update code references if line numbers changed significantly
3. Update README.md if user-facing behavior changed
4. Keep both docs consistent and in sync
